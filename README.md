Teacher Motivation, Productivity, and Workload Dashboard
üìö Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard was inspired by my previous research in higher education, which focused on the motivation challenges faced by university professors. The data used for this project was generated by ChatGPT, based on my assumptions and insights derived from my academic experience. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of how workload and discrimination impact the motivation and productivity of university professors.

üéØ Objective
The primary objectives of this dashboard are:

To explore the distribution of motivation levels among university professors.
To analyze the impact of workload and discrimination on productivity and motivation.
To identify trends and relationships between workload, discrimination, and productivity.
To provide actionable insights for improving the performance and satisfaction of university professors.
